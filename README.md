# BulgyoLoc, a geographical approach to Korean Buddhism.

Temples play a pivotal role in the development and stabilization of religious movements, especially in the case of imported religions, in which the new religions have to find their way through already established beliefs, rituals, and cultural traditions. Through accessible technology, easy to understand and operate, an overview of the panorama of Buddhist temples throughout the Korean Peninsula can be consulted in BulgyoLoc. 

This project revolves around an interactive map created using technology from ArcGIS. This digital resource serves as a visual representation of the physical presence of Buddhism throughout the Korean Peninsula in which the temples are disposed dynamically, also accompanied by other data about each temple, making it an optimal starting point for commencing research of Korean Buddhism. The majority of the information herein shown has been extracted from governmental resources and open data projects.

The main goals of this project are to: a) serve as an academic data collection; b) become a bigger and more complex project overtime in which numerous scholars can participate; c) be a guide for both junior scholars whore are starting their study of Korean religions and more experienced scholars who may need a visual resource.
